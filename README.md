# LatexCV

I am working on a Latex template to keep my updated CV. Feel free to reuse or contribute if you find it useful.


## Recommended usage
* Fork the repository (so that you can keep updated with my new changes)
* Create an empty project on Overleaf (you may call it myCV, for example)
* Link your Overleaf Project myCV with your forked Github Repository
* Pull the changes from Github to your Overleaf myCV
