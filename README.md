# LatexCV

I am working on a Latex template to keep my updated CV. Feel free to reuse, if you find it useful. Code contributions are welcome. Stars are appreciated.


## Recommended usage
* Fork the repository (so that you can keep updated with my new changes)
* Create an empty project on Overleaf (you may call it myCV, for example)
* Link your Overleaf Project myCV with your forked Github Repository
* Pull the changes from Github to your Overleaf myCV

## Example
* My associated Overleaf project can be viewed [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qhjmhvkkbckv#348ad0) as an example.
